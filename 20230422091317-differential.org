#+title: Differential Ontology

Differential ontology understands the identity of any given thing
as\constituted on the basis of the ever-changing nexus of relations in
which it is found. Therefore identity is a secondary determination,
while difference, or the constitutive relations that make up
identities, is primary.

Time - puncti-linear, a whole series of 'now' points. Husserl - time
is not experienced as a series of discrete, independent moments, but
is always thick with past and future.  (phenomenology)
