#+title: A world beyond physics: the emergence and evolution of life


[Xnl] Constraint closure - A set of both constraints on the release of
energy in nonequilibrium processes and those processes, such that the
system constructs its own constraints... Cells do this automobiles do
not.

[26] In fact constraints and work can do work to build more
constraints! The next time it rains, the hot hole in the dirt might
become a mud puddle. Or the water from the pail might spill on the
ground, flow down the hill, and cut a small dirt groove from the top
of the well to my bean field. Thereafter, I could use that groove
rather than the tube to funnel water to the field. The groove is a new
boundary condition.

[40] Erdos and Renyi asked what happens to a random graph as the ratio
of edges to vertices increases: that is more and more lines connect
the dots. For E/V less than 0.5, the graph has a large number of
disconnected "components" But when E/V crosses the threshold,
connected structures emerge. E/V = 0.5, then, is a phase transition
where suddenly small connected clusters merge into what is called the
giant component of the graph.

[53] Cells do cycles of work to construct approximate second copies of
themselves as physical objects when they reproduce... These are
examples of propagating work and the propagating organisation of the
living world. The evolving biosphere /is/ this coconstructing
propagation, subject to heritable variation and natural
selection... It surges upward in complexity and diversity into the
indefinite, non-ergodic universe above the level of atoms. Hearts come
to exist.

[84] Work done to reproduce and further construct order is faster than
the second law of thermodynamics dissipates that order.

[91] Consider a bacterium swimming up a glucose gradient. The sugar
matters to the bacterium. Mattering is now part of the
universe. Agency introduces meaning to the world! Agency is
fundamental to life.
