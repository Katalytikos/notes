#+title: Assemblage Theory


[p2] (too spatial) A better choice would be intrinsic and extrinsic,
but the intent is clear: if a relation constitutes the very identity
of what it relates it cannot respect the heterogeneity of the
components, but rather it tends to fuse them together into a
homogenous whole.

[p21] Downward causality - Wholes emerge bottom up, depending causally
on their components, but have a top down influence. This d-c is needed
to account for the fact that most assemblages are composed of parts
that come into existence after the whole has emerged.

[p27] Ritual as coded habit?

[p29] Any event that takes attention away from the subject of
conversation to focus it elsewhere can destabilise this assemblage.

[p120] Attractors and their basins define zones of stability, since
they pin down trajectories to a small set of states and do not let
them escape.
